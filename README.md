# AWS-CI-CD-Project
The provided configuration appears to be a buildspec.yaml file for an AWS CodeBuild project. It defines the build phases, environment settings, and artifacts for building and packaging a Java application using Maven. Let’s break it down:

Environment Settings:
The runtime-versions section specifies that the Java runtime version should be Amazon Corretto 8.
The apt-get commands update the package manager and install the jq utility.
The wget command downloads the Maven binary distribution.
The tar command extracts the Maven archive.
The ln command creates a symbolic link named “maven” to the extracted Maven directory.
The sed commands modify the application.properties file, replacing database connection details.
Build Phases:
The install phase sets up the environment and installs dependencies.
The pre_build phase prepares Maven and modifies the application properties.
The build phase runs the Maven build process (e.g., compiling, testing, packaging).
The post_build phase performs additional tasks after the build.
Artifacts:
The artifacts section specifies the files to include in the build artifact.
The base directory for the artifact is target/vprofile-v2.
